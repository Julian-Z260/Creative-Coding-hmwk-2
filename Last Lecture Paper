Achieving ones own dreams is exteremely important but what is even more important is having them.  All throughout my life, my mother has instilled a sense of purpose into my being.  I have gone through my entire life knowing what I want and who I am.  I am a being full of purpose and power and I still chase after those dreams I had ever since I was young.  Nothing was too big or too small, too far out there, or too easy to grab.  My mom helped me understand that I can change the world so long as I try.  And try I did/do.  All I ever wanted to be when I was young was to be a hero and right now I am on track to becoming one, in my own way that is.
