Having a one track mindset is something many people in this world have and it is very hard to get out of.  Those however who are willing to let go and to move forward through life with an open mind are more likely to succeed.  I myself like to think I'm a pretty open minded kind of guy.  It doesn't matter what the subject is whether it be political views, religion, or just a simple conversation myself and a buddy would have, I always see it through their lense or at least I try to.  If I don't understand I'd ask them to clairfy it for me so we can both have a civil discussion.
